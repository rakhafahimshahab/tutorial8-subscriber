## Questions
*What is AMQP?* The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard for passing messages between applications or organizations with a lot of flexibility in terms of message routing, reliability, and security.
*Understanding `amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672:`*
- `guest:guest` represents the default username and password.
- `localhost:5672` is the network address and port where the AMQP server (like RabbitMQ) listens by default.
